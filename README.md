# My Excel Data Analytics Project
Here comes my first excel projects
## Revenue Dashboard
In this project, I have created a dashboard which helps to get the revenue of a restuarant based on its various parameters like branches, food category and count of different food items. This can be used in real time projects to identify the categories that brings more and least revenue and least revenue branches and food categories can be added few measures to upscale in its revenue.

Here in the above image you can view the revenue displayed as per Branch 'Kolapakkam' selected and revenue displayed for the food category selected as 'Desert'. Similarly it will get displayed based on the branches selected and food categories selected.
