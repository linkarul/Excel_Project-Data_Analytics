# My Excel Data Analytics Project
Here comes my first excel projects
## Revenue Dashboard
In this project, I have created a dashboard which helps to get the revenue of a restuarant based on its various parameters like branches, food category and count of different food items. This can be used in real time projects to identify the categories that brings more and least revenue and least revenue branches and food categories can be added few measures to upscale in its revenue.

Here in the above image you can view the revenue displayed as per Branch 'Kolapakkam' selected and revenue displayed for the food category selected as 'Desert'. Similarly it will get displayed based on the branches selected and food categories selected.As well you can get the count of food items ordered.

## Revenue Grouping
In this project we get the count of food items ordered as per the branches.Here the grouping is done based on different branches of Chennai City based on its zone.Here we use advanced excel concepts like pivoting and as well used slicers to filter data based on branches.

In above example we have filtered the data based on south zone and we can see the branches that falls under the same and its corresponding food order count.
